More of a prototype than anything else, this mod allows you to browse servers created and shared by other users with the mod.
Servers are ordered by most recently created (times are in UTC+0).

Please report any bugs, errors, unintended behavior or complaints so I can fix it, thank you! (@Uziskull ðŸ”§#9341)

# Reminder:
Servers are only accessible if the host has forwarded his ports. This mod **does not** forward your ports, nor does it display proxied or otherwise modified IP addresses (like those of Hamachi, Evolve, etc).

# Usage:
- **Joining a server:**
    1. In the main menu, select ``Start Online Co-op``.
    2. You will see a display like the one below. Pressing ``Refresh`` will get the most recent servers available.
    ![Server Browser](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/325414004266762250/662319536195764250/1.png "Server Browser")
    3. Read the IP of the server you want to connect to and type it in the fields above, like you usually would.
- **Creating a server**:
    1. In the main menu, select ``Start Online Co-op``.
    2. Type your desired port and maximum number of players.
        - **WARNING:** due to unaccessible variables, a workaround had to be introduced in order to get these values. When typing both fields (**mandatory** for the first time using the mod), please **do not paste text in** and confirm both the port and maximum number of players are correct with the debug text displayed in the upper left corner of the screen!
        ![Debug Text](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/325414004266762250/662322617994444821/3.png "Debug Text")
    3. Press ``Host Game``, like you normally would.
    4. Press ``Submit`` on the popup displayed in the upper-left corner of the character selection screen, like the one below. If no errors are displayed, congratulations! Your server is now displayed on other people's server browser **for the next 5 minutes**.
    ![Submit Popup](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/325414004266762250/662319554307031087/2.png "Submit Popup")
    5. Your server will remain visible to everyone until one of these has happened:
        - 5 minutes have passed;
        - The lobby was cancelled;
        - The game began.

# Planned features/roadmap:
- Get important variables directly instead of using a workaround (not possible atm)
- Joining servers by simply clicking instead of having to type (not possible atm)
